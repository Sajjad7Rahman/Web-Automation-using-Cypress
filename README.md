# Web-Automation-using-Cypress

# Cypress:

Cypress is a popular framework for automating web applications. It specializes in end-to-end (E2E) testing and provides a powerful set of tools for automating interactions with web application as a
user would. This framework captures snapshots at the time of test execution that allows QAs or developers to hover over a specific command in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at
that particular step. One doesn't need to add explicit or implicit wait commands in test scripts. Cypress runs tests directly in the browser, resulting in faster test execution times compared
to other testing frameworks.
